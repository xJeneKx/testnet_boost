# testnet boost

This script generates new transactions on testnet to speed up stabilization. If you are testing something and stabilization takes too long, run this script.


## Quick start
1) clone this repository
2) install dependencies (npm/yarn) 
3) run faucet.js
4) run boost.js

The first launch can be long, due to the waiting for stabilization. Subsequent launches will be fast.
